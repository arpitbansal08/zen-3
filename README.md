Task 3: Create a dashboard with charts and other metrics

Description

A React dashboard application built with Tailwind CSS for user authentication and data visualization.

Installation

Clone this repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/arpitbansal08/zen-3.git

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd Task3

Install dependencies:

Bash
npm install

 Running the Application

Start the development server:

Bash
npm start

 This will start the React development server and open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling. The configuration is located in tailwind.config.js.

Authentication for Dashboard using Navigate in React

The current implementation assumes a hardcoded password (ZenTradesTest@123).
Update this with your desired authentication mechanism (e.g., form-based login, API integration).
Dashboard Layout

The dashboard layout is built using React components that leverage Tailwind CSS classes. You can customize the layout and styling based on your preferences.
Forgot Password Link:

Clicking the link opens the user's default email client with a pre-filled email address (support@zentrades.pro) but doesn't send an actual email. Configure your email client to handle this behavior.

Chart JS
Chart.js is a powerful and easy-to-use JavaScript library for creating interactive charts. It offers a wide variety of chart types and customization options, making it suitable for visualizing data in various ways on your React dashboard.

Installation:

Using npm:

Bash
npm install chart.js


Importing Chart.js:

Import the necessary components from Chart.js into your React component where you want to render the chart:

JavaScript
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { Chart as ChartJS } from 'chart.js/auto';
